You have done your fair share of work and still need to be paid some respect, but now is not the time to act in an aggressive way.
Try to keep your plans light over the next few days, especially if they are of a financial nature.
Keep your ideas to yourself for a while and don’t let anyone in on a secret that could be used against you.
No matter how badly the first attempt failed you would still be amazed how easily it worked in the end.
Your first task today and over the weekend is to get them to see sense, not just in their words but in your actions.
You know what needs to be done.
It’s all about style – no doubt about that.
Be positive.
Some people may say that you are desperate but if you make the effort you will find it will pay off in ways you have not anticipated.
Just because certain things do not work out the way you expected does not mean it is not possible.
A clash of egos could break out today and if you are wise you will sit back and watch the two feud for a few hours.

If you want to get noticed you will have to spell out in plain and simple language what it is you want to accomplish.
Let the important people know they can trust you.
Don’t make a big deal of it though, don’t let it bother you.
It’s time to start seeing a better world!
Make a point of getting assistance from people who can help you move up in the world.
That would be foolish, and most likely dangerous.
The simple fact is you have obligations to fulfill but you also have to be aware of them and that means paying the price of some of the people you most want to see.
The planets warn that a family matter that does not concern you will come up for air today, so let things happen for a while.

The planets indicate that, when it comes right down to it, everything will work out for the best.
You need to be totally honest with yourself about your feelings.
The less you say too much about a loved one’s behavior the more likely it is they will try to make you feel bad about yourself.

You may feel confident on the work front but don’t get too pushy about it.
Try not to get too aggressive about something that does not concern you directly or take on the world at large.
Others may complain that you are not doing enough but you will get over it and move on.

If you have something to say this is the perfect time to make waves.
It’s good that you feel you can get away with whatever you want this weekend but be sensible about it.
A family member will sing your praises today and with good reason – you are the kind of person who will happily do whatever it takes to please their extended family.
The important thing is that you stop being so intense about it and focus on what is really important: your health.

It’s time to go public with your feelings.
Your mind will be open and honest today and that’s a huge plus.

It’s no big deal, in fact it’s nothing bad.

This may not be the most productive time of the year for you but there is no need to panic – you are under no obligation to do anything special.
And you'll be the life and soul of the party.
Try not to make any sudden moves today.
Don’t worry too much about other people – you will deal with them all better in the long-term.

If it’s really so bad the worst possible thing you can do is to just get on and do what makes you happy.

Make sure you get the right advice.
And there is no blame but the woman and the child.
Try not to go too hard.
You may be tempted to splash out on something but you are advised to look at it in a light-hearted manner – it will certainly do you good.
Don’t make too big an issue of it though.
A problem you thought had been resolved will return in waves over the next 24 hours.

Make the effort, and make it work.
You will find that, if you make a conscious effort to be positive in your thinking, positive things will occur.
